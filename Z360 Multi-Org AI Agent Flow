**Operations**:
- Loads previous conversation messages and thread state
- Restores user context (org_id, user_id, phone_number)
- Retrieves current ability state and workflow progress
- Initializes session-specific variables and preferences

**STM Components**:
- Current conversation messages
- Active workflow state
- Temporary variables

### 2. Route Node (Context Resolution)
**Purpose**: Determines organizational and user context for memory namespace selection
**Operations**:
- Maps phone number to user and organization

### 3. Load Memories Node (LTM Retrieval)
**Purpose**: Retrieves relevant long-term memories from Qdrant vector collections with user-state awareness
**Operations**:
- Performs semantic search across org-specific memory collections
- Retrieves episodic memories (past conversations and interaction summaries)
- Loads semantic memories (user preferences, org facts, learned patterns)
- Accesses procedural memories (successful workflow patterns and trigger improvements)
- Applies user-state filtering (registered users get full context, unregistered get limited)

**LTM Collections Accessed**:
- `org_{id}_episodic`: Historical conversation summaries and interaction outcomes
- `org_{id}_semantic`: User facts, preferences, and organizational knowledge
- `org_{id}_procedural`: Successful process patterns and improved trigger recognition
- `org_{id}_knowledge`: Organizational documents and FAQs

**Memory-Enhanced Capabilities**:
- **Trigger Recognition**: Uses procedural memories to improve intent matching accuracy

```

## Advanced Trigger Processing

### Four-Tier Trigger Matching System (Memory-Enhanced)

The system implements sophisticated trigger recognition that adapts based on user registration status, match confidence, and historical memory patterns:

#### For Registered Users
1. **Deterministic Match**: Word-for-word trigger matching → Immediate ability execution
2. **Probabilistic Match**: Intent-based matching → Confirmation request → Execution

#### For Unregistered Users  
1. **Deterministic Match (Available)**: Direct execution of non-registration abilities
2. **Probabilistic Match (Available)**: Confirmation → Execution if confirmed
3. **Deterministic Match (Registration Required)**: Registration flow explanation → Consent → Link
4. **Probabilistic Match (Registration Required)**: Clarification → Registration explanation → Consent

### Memory-Enhanced Trigger Recognition

- Organization: MindWell Clinic
- Request: "I need to reschedule my Tuesday appointment"

**Flow Execution**:

1. **Load Checkpoint**: Restores previous conversation about initial booking
2. **Route**: Phone → Sarah → MindWell Clinic
3. **Load Memories**:
   - Episodic: "Sarah booked Tuesday 2pm with Dr. Johnson"
   - Semantic: "Sarah prefers morning appointments, has work conflicts"
   - Procedural: "Rescheduling workflow: check availability → offer alternatives"
4. **Registered Flow**: Personalized greeting with context
5. **Ability Engine**: Executes rescheduling ability with memory context
6. **Response**: "Hi Sarah! I see you have Tuesday 2pm with Dr. Johnson. Let me find morning alternatives for you."

### Memory-Enhanced Prompt Engineering

#### Self-Verification Patterns (Enhanced)
```
"Before responding, check retrieved memories for relevant context. Ask yourself:
1. 'What do I remember about this user's preferences?'
2. 'Have we had similar conversations before?'
3. 'What worked well in past interactions?'
4. 'Are there any procedural patterns that apply here?'"
```

#### Pre-validation Logic (Memory-Informed)
```
"Before asking for information, check both current variables AND retrieved memories. 
Ask yourself: 'Do I already have this information from previous conversations or user profile?' 
If yes, use the remembered information and skip the question."
```

#### Response Categorization (Memory-Enhanced)
The system now considers memory context when categorizing user responses:
1. **Direct Answer**: Enhanced with preference matching from semantic memories
2. **Information Request**: Informed by previous successful information delivery patterns
3. **Related/Unrelated Request**: Uses episodic memories to understand context relationships
4. **Ticket Status**: Enhanced with historical ticket interaction patterns
5. **Unclear Path**: Uses procedural memories to suggest clarification strategies

### Conversation Continuation Logic (Memory-Enhanced)
```
"After user registration, check episodic memories: 'What ability triggered this registration?' 
Use retrieved context to immediately resume the interrupted workflow with full user context."

"When an ability ends, analyze episodic memories: 'Has this user typically continued with related requests?' 
Use patterns to proactively offer relevant next steps."
```

## Advanced State Management

### Variable System Architecture
The system maintains sophisticated state management across conversation flows:

#### Variable Lifecycle
1. **Initialization**: Variables created via ASK steps or DO step results
2. **Persistence**: Stored in ability_variables throughout workflow execution
3. **Interpolation**: Dynamic replacement in prompts using `{variable_name}` syntax
4. **Merging**: Smart updates that preserve existing data while adding new information
5. **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup at ability completion

#### State Injection Patterns
```python
# For registered users, automatic context injection
if user_status == "registered":
    ability_variables.update({
        "user_id": state.user.user_id,
        "user_name": state.user.name,
        "user_email": state.user.email,
        "user_phone": state.user.phone
    })
```

#### Cross-Step Data Flow
